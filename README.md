# Murder Grill

## Meat. Murder. Mayhem.
<p>Alliteration.</p>

<p>An ironic / satirical webpage for a fictional grill place that *really* loves meat.</p>
<p>This is a group exercise from Social Hackers Academy where I learned more about npm and webpack, as well as the usage of modules in breaking down code components.</p>

<p>Every single element is dynamically being generated via JavaScript DOM manipulation as the actual HTML file only begins with a single empty div. The tabs themselves are switched dynamically in the same page as well.</p>

<p>Responsive for anything more than 320 pixels wide.</p>
